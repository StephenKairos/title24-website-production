      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Before a permit is issued, one must submit a&nbsp;<em> CF-1R Energy Compliance Report</em> to the building department as a requirement. This has to be approved by the city for the following: </strong></p>
      <b-list-group>
          <b-list-group-item><strong>New construction for residential and commercial building<br>
              </strong>
          </b-list-group-item>

      <p>Do you find preparing the California Title 24 Energy Calculation Report requirement frustrating? If so, we understand what you’re going through.</p>
      <p>Like most people, there’s nothing more frustrating than starting out full of drive and excitement, making good progress on your goals for weeks; only to be sidetracked by another requirement from the city as your plans are yet to be adjusted by more hours of research. You end up feeling exhausted and confused because you’re trying to figure out everything on your own and nothing you do seems to get you to that next level.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Until recently, the only way to be compliant with this building requirement was to scour and read through hundreds of pages,&nbsp; and figure out which form is needed by the city. This requires a steep learning curve and many hours of sifting through endless loads of information. The big problem with this option is that it takes long hours and arduous days to learn. It requires tons of practice, and there’s no real way to get good without copping your fair share of falls. For someone who has an important project and an impending deadline to beat; delving to know and get educated on yet another requirement when you are running a tight ship is simply not worth the risk.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">That is the very reason why we are here.
